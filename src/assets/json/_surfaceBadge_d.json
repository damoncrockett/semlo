Subject matter and composition are of great importance in producing prize-winning photographs. But the key to success is often in the over-all feeling created by the contrast of the print.

Much as an oil painter uses light or dark colored oils, the pictorialist uses high contrast to brighten over-all appearance or create a dramatic effect. Low contrast may be used to flatten harsh light tones which distract from the center of interest. In all phases of photography, contrast and tone control are the tools of the craftsman.
