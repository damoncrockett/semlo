Subject matter and composition are of great importance in producing prize-winning photographs. But the key to success is often in the over-all feeling created by the contrast of the print. Artists and pictorial photographers use contrast as a tool to create a mood that captures the emotions felt when viewing the original subject. Much as an oil painter uses light or dark colored oils, the pictorialist uses high contrast to brighten over-all appearance or create a dramatic effect. Low contrast may be used to flatten harsh light tones which distract from the center of interest. In all phases of photography, contrast and tone control are the tools of the craftsman. In recent years, more and more photographers have turned to “Varigam” for the utmost flexibility in contrast control.

That's partly because Cykora comes in a good selection of surfaces, ranging from the textured Kashmir to the popular Cykora Glossy which are all available in evenly spaced contrast grades that match most negatives. Bur most of all, it’s because Cykora’s rich emulsion gives you unusual exposure-development latitude, and is readily responsive to various developers and toners. For example, Cykora yields tones of pleasing warmth when developed in Ansco Ardol, while Vividol developer produces stronger, more neutral blacks.
