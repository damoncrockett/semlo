9,Kodak,Medalist,,pmeasured,"This new Kodak projection paper brings you an entirely new combination of desirable features. It has just the right degree of warmth to enhance the best qualities of the majority of your pictures. It has just the right speed to make its handling in the darkroom easy and pleasurable...and the speed of all four contrast grades is essentially the same. The big news, though, is in the outstanding flexibility of this new paper. By varying the ratio of exposure and development, contrasts can be sharply changed in the finished print without any degradation of the quality or tone. Long exposure and short development result in a soft print. Short exposure and prolonged development increase contrast in the print. This factor—with the four grades of contrast in which Kodak Medalist Paper will be available—means that you will now be able to obtain easily a completely graduated range of contrasts to match the requirements of any negative. Kodak Medalist Paper tones beautifully. Use Kodak Brown Toner, Kodak Sepia Toner, Kodak Blue Toner, hypo-alum, or Kodak Toner T-7a.

The favorite salon types are E (white, fine grained, lustre), G (cream white, fine grained, lustre), and P (old ivory, fine grained, lustre). ‘Fine grained’ denotes a delicately pebbled texture which subdues graininess in high-ratio enlargements from small negatives—yet does not break down the effect of fine detail. “Lustre” identifies a pleasing surface sparkle—just enough to lend life to the print surface, but not so insistent as to impair visibility of the image. Among these papers, the three stock tints give you a primary basis for selection. The rich ivory tint is your natural choice for scenes which suggest or include firelight, candlelight, or lamplight... for character studies and strongly masculine portrait studies...and wherever you desire an efiect of extreme warmth or a feeling of mellow antiquity. Pure white, at the opposite end of the tint scale, is the apt choice for seascapes, snow scenes, and other cool, high-key subjects—as well as full-scale subjects which require brilliant white, cool neutral grays, and rich cold blacks in the print.

11,Kodak,Medalist,F,pmeasured,"This new Kodak projection paper brings you an entirely new combination of desirable features. It has just the right degree of warmth to enhance the best qualities of the majority of your pictures. It has just the right speed to make its handling in the darkroom easy and pleasurable...and the speed of all four contrast grades is essentially the same. The big news, though, is in the outstanding flexibility of this new paper. By varying the ratio of exposure and development, contrasts can be sharply changed in the finished print without any degradation of the quality or tone. Long exposure and short development result in a soft print. Short exposure and prolonged development increase contrast in the print. This factor—with the four grades of contrast in which Kodak Medalist Paper will be available—means that you will now be able to obtain easily a completely graduated range of contrasts to match the requirements of any negative. Kodak Medalist Paper tones beautifully. Use Kodak Brown Toner, Kodak Sepia Toner, Kodak Blue Toner, hypo-alum, or Kodak Toner T-7a.

Cykora tones beautifully, too, giving you outstanding quality on every possible count.

Performance is everywhere in a Cykora enlargement. In the sparkling highlights . . . in the warm middle tones . . . in the deep, rich, luminous shadows. Everywhere, you'll find the kind of re-production that makes for true exhibition quality.

That's partly because Cykora comes in a good selection of surfaces, ranging from the textured Kashmir to the popular Cykora Glossy which are all available in evenly spaced contrast grades that match most negatives. Bur most of all, it’s because Cykora’s rich emulsion gives you unusual exposure-development latitude, and is readily responsive to various developers and toners. For example, Cykora yields tones of pleasing warmth when developed in Ansco Ardol, while Vividol developer produces stronger, more neutral blacks.

27,Dupont,Varigam,,pmeasured,"Better Prints Can Be Yours Through Contrast Control. Subject matter and composition are of great importance in producing prize-winning photographs. But the key to success is often in the over-all feeling created by the contrast of the print. Artists and pictorial photographers use contrast as a tool to create a mood that captures the emotions felt when viewing the original subject. Much as an oil painter uses light or dark colored oils, the pictorialist uses high contrast to brighten over-all appearance or create a dramatic effect. Low contrast may be used to flatten harsh light tones which distract from the center of interest. In all phases of photography, contrast and tone control are the tools of the craftsman. In recent years, more and more photographers have turned to “Varigam” for the utmost flexibility in contrast control. Du Pont “Varigam” variable contrast photographic enlarging paper can provide whatever contrast is needed to make a perfect print from any negative. With the filters and “Varigam” you can produce prints ranging in contrast from extremely soft to exceptionally hard. One package of “Varigam” and a set of filters bring all paper contrast grades within your reach. Without filters “Varigam” is a normal contrast enlarging paper for top-quality prints.

27,Dupont,Varigam,,pmeasured,"Many well-known photographers prefer Du Pont “Varigam” photographic paper because of the ease with which its contrast may be matched to any printable negative. Still another reason why many professionals use “Varigam” is because several different contrasts may be printed on any one sheet of paper by using two or more filters...stated in his new book, “Architectural Photography of Houses”: “Probably the best way to have control over all pictures which feature window areas or indoor-outdoor relationship is with the use of ‘Varigam’ paper. All pictures in this book were printed on Varigam paper to insure proper contrasts and to control the difficult lighting in many of the scenes.”","Popular Photography, October 1953, page 29",scans/image00029.jpg
27,Dupont,Varigam,,pmeasured,"“Varigam” changes in contrast according to the color of the printing light and can be easily made to match the widest negative demands of contrast and tone range. ‘Varigam’...can control the tone I want in my prints...particularly where merchandise and models are concerned. Most of my work is for reproduction in magazines, and print tones are important. With ‘Varigam,’ however, I can control light, medium and the darker tones...make a high-key print and yet retain all the desired detail. ‘Varigam’ has so many control advantages over ordinary paper that it makes printing without variable contrast control practically obsolete. “Varigam” will make prints of the contrast you want from every negative...soft, normal or hard.","Popular Photography, April 1954, page 164",scans/image00164.jpg
27,Dupont,Varigam,,pmeasured,"Many workers find that Varigam fulfills all of their requirements. Others continue to depend upon the conventional graded papers, resorting to processing manipulations for difficult negatives, using Varigam as a last resort for between-grade negatives.

27,Dupont,Varigam,,pmeasured,"Thin, flat negatives like the one at far left require radical treatment...The print above was made on Varigam with a No. 10 filter—the technique for greatest contrast on this paper. Still the print is somewhat flat, lacking dense blacks and crisp highlights. This makes it appear the picture was made on overcast day, though sun was shining. Contrastiest paper available is Kodabromide No. 5. This print, made on it from the same negative, has snap and sparkle, good blacks and sunny highlights—with detail in both. Such an extreme problem does not often arise, but many Varigam users keep a supply of Kodabromide: No. 5 on hand, anticipating emergencies like this. High Speed Varigam can render the softest contrast level of any regularly used enlarging paper. With extra-contrast negatives (the kind that result from over-souping overexposed film) this quality is a lifesaver. The use of a #1 filter on a condenser enlarger will give a contrast at least one full grade below that of Kodabromide F1.","Popular Photography, May 1954, page 58",scans/image00058.jpg
